    {question: `In several videos you've talked about your time as a security officer. Recently, out of desperation for not finding work elsewhere, I too have become a security officer.

    {question: `Although it was disliked by many others, I thought moon gaming was good at giving a creepy vibe while still staying humorous. It felt like there was some unspeakable horror watching you and your guest, and the only thing that kept your mind off it was talking about the video game being presented.

    {question: `I'm sure you've heard of Warner Brothers buying Machinima. What's your thoughts on this buyout? Is it just a case of another "Sithlord" beating another one?`, time: '40m20s'},
    {question: `Ross, I know you're not likely to do another moon gaming, but if you could have anyone, living, not quite as alive, and/or fictional, who would you get?`, time: '43m36s'},
